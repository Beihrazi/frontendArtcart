MY ROLE:
I designed the frontend using Figma and having completed the blueprint. I developed the user interface (UI) for the customer role, while my team member assisted with the UI for the admin and seller roles. After receiving their inputs, I made further edits to ensure consistency and functionality across the platform.
For the backend, I built the server using Express.js and MongoDB
